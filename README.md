#### This repository presents different tools that have been developed, as part of a research work that begins in 2018, and with which it seeks to contribute to the development of SLAM.
#### in it different tools from different authors are incorporated and that are the result of other investigations, that have been developed in previous years and that evolve in parallel to this, we hope that users share their experiences with us when using the information presented here.
#### Here you will find videos, Dataset and codes that will be open.

##### The detection of dynamic objects online is a factor of great complexity, and even more so when it is done with humans given the body presents irregularities, below we present the results of the application of the method in the detection of a human, at walking speed, in an interior space and with an irregular path.

##### The reduction of the computational cost is a factor of great importance in the development of online systems, and the application of the Open3d voxel grid is one of the main tools used in this research to achieve this purpose, in which the density of points of the point cloud, without losing the main characteristics, the following shows the variations of the resulting point cloud by varying the size of the edge of the point cloud

### dynamic object detection
##### In this test, the follow-up achieved by performing the segmentation of the points corresponding to the dynamic object is observed. Several stages of segmentation have been applied to these: segmentation by points of high variability and segmentation by clustering. sensory fusion helps reduce computational cost and enables online tracking. In this, a vehicle that has a screen was used as a dynamic object, to give uniformity to its surface.
