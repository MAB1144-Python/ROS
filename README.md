# Detection, segmentation and removal of dynamic objects, for Point Cloud reconstruction
#### This repository presents different tools that have been developed, as part of a research work that begins in 2018, and with which it seeks to contribute to the development of SLAM.
#### in it different tools from different authors are incorporated and that are the result of other investigations, that have been developed in previous years and that evolve in parallel to this, we hope that users share their experiences with us when using the information presented here.
#### Here you will find videos, Dataset and codes that will be open.
